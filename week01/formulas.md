# Key Formulas – Panel Data (Week 1)

## Pooled OLS Model:
Y_it = β₀ + β₁X₁_it + ... + β_kX_k_it + u_it

- No unit-specific or time-specific effects
- Treats all observations as homogeneous

## Panel Data Structure:
- i = 1, ..., N (units: individuals, firms, countries)
- t = 1, ..., T (time periods: years, quarters)

Total Observations = N × T

## Types of Effects:
- Unit Effects: μᵢ (individual-specific fixed effect)
- Time Effects: λₜ (time-specific shock)

## Balanced vs. Unbalanced Panels:
- Balanced: Data available for every unit across all time periods
- Unbalanced: Some units have missing time observations
