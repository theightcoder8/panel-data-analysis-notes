# ðŸ“˜ Week 3 â€“ Fixed Effects Model

This week, we focus on the **Fixed Effects (FE) Model**, a key method used when unobserved unit-specific effects (Î¼áµ¢) are correlated with explanatory variables. We introduce two main estimation techniques:
- The **Within Estimator** (Grup Ä°Ã§i Tahminci)
- The **Least Squares Dummy Variable (LSDV)** Estimator

The **Grunfeld Investment Dataset** is used for implementation.

## ðŸ§® Theoretical Model

### Fixed Effects (One-way) Panel Model
```
Y_it = Î²X_it + Î¼áµ¢ + u_it
```
- Î¼áµ¢: Unobserved time-invariant individual effect
- u_it: Idiosyncratic error term

---

### 1. Within Estimator (Grup Ä°Ã§i Tahminci)
Removes Î¼áµ¢ by transforming variables using time-demeaning:
```
Y_it - È²_i = Î²(X_it - XÌ„_i) + (u_it - Å«_i)
```

STATA:
```stata

```

### 2. LSDV â€“ Least Squares Dummy Variable
Adds (N-1) dummies to capture unit-specific intercepts:
```
Y_it = Î²X_it + D_i + u_it
```

STATA:
```stata
