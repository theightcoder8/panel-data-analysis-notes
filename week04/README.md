# ðŸ“˜ Week 4 â€“ Random Effects, GEKK and MLE Estimators

This week introduces the **Random Effects (RE) Model** in panel data. Unlike Fixed Effects, the RE model assumes the individual-specific effect (Î¼áµ¢) is random and uncorrelated with explanatory variables. We also cover the Generalized Least Squares (GLS) method and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for RE models.

## ðŸ”¢ Core Equations

### Random Effects Model
```
Y_it = Î²X_it + Î¼áµ¢ + u_it
```
where:  
- Î¼áµ¢ ~ N(0, ÏƒÂ²_Î¼)  
- u_it ~ N(0, ÏƒÂ²_u)

---

### GLS Transformation (Theta):
```
Î¸ = 1 - [ÏƒÂ²_u / (T * ÏƒÂ²_Î¼ + ÏƒÂ²_u)]^0.5
```

Transformed equation:
```
(Y_it - Î¸Â·È²_i) = Î²(X_it - Î¸Â·XÌ„_i) + (Î½_it - Î¸Â·Î½Ì„_i)
```

---

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

When Î¼áµ¢ and u_it are both normally distributed, the log-likelihood function can be derived and optimized to estimate Î², ÏƒÂ²_Î¼, and ÏƒÂ²_u.
